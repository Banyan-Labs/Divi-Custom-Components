### Running sample.html

Just run html file directly in browser.


### Using in a Divi code module

- within div#cardstrip, replace existing html with your own content.  
- Be sure to use class .blcard for building your content.
- add styles as desired, targeting .blcard as a parent selector to your content.

- create a new Divi code module and drop in the code.


This is just a stash for now.  We don't have established practices around this yet.

Also, this is not a great long-term solution, but it gets us going for now.
